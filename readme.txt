== Usage ==

DP Widget Plus generates friendly markup for custom styling in your own stylesheet.

Before using DP Widget Plus, the HTML markup of each widget usually like this:
	
	<div id="widget-xxx" class="widget">
		<h3 class="widget-title">Widget Title</h3>
		<!-- Different output for each widget -->
	</div>
	
After using DP Widget Plus(We assume that all options of DP Widget Plus has been used), the HTML markup of a widget will like this:

	<div id="widget-xxx" class="widget">
		<h3 class="widget-title">
			<a href="#" class="widget-icon"><img src="" /></a>
			<span class="widget-main-title">Widget Title</span>
			<span class="widget-sub-title">Widget sub title</span>
		</h3>
		<!-- Different output for each widget -->
		<div class="widget-footer"></div>
	</div>

So, you can style the output with these CSS selectors: 
	
	<style type="text/css">
	.widget-icon{}
	.widget-icon img{}
	.widget-main-title{}
	.widget-sub-title{}
	.widget-footer{}
	</style>
